The Finite Element Library -  Release 3.0

(C) 2014 Chris Greenough 


=======================================================================

The Finite Element Library (FELIB) is a program and subroutine 
library for the solution of partial differential equations using 
the finite element method.

This software is for the use of the academic community in their
personal research and not for commercial exploitation. It comes
with no guarantees in any form concerning it correctness or fitness
for purpose.

Anyone wishing to make commercial use the software should contact
the Head of the Mathematical Software Group.

1.Introduction

FELIB is very simple to install and only requires a Fortran 77 compiler.
It should also be possbile to use a Fortran 90/95 compiler.

The library has the following directories:

	* machine - machine dependent routines (defaults should work ok)
	* library - basic library routines
	* programs - example programs
	* data - example data
	* results - results generated on Redhat 7.2 using g77
	* Makefile - make file
	* install.txt - this file

2.Installation

The version on the web has been compiled and tested under Linux 
(Redhat 7.2) using g77 and the Lahey Fortran 95 compiler.

* Copy the tar file to a suitable area
* Extract the contents - this will produce a directory felib3.0
* Change directory to felib3.0
* You will need to modify the machine dependent routines in directory
  machine with the necessary values for your system.
* Type make FC=<compiler> - the default is f77
* If you use g77 or a Fortran 90/95 compiler there will be complaints
  about the intrinsic function MATMUL and a few CHARACTER based warnings
* Change directory to programs 
* Type ./test-run.sh - this will run all the programs and compare the
  results with those provide with 'diff'. If the files are not empty
  have a look at the differences.

3.Help

You can always drop me an Email and I will do what I can.

Best of luck
