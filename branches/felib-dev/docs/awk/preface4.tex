\centerline{\bf PREFACE - RELEASE 4} 
\vspace*{5mm}

The Finite Element Library is now forming an important part of many
research projects using numerical methods. The usage of the Library
has grown greatly with the help of the Numerical Algorithms Group Ltd
and Release~4 is well due.

It is pleasing to report that over the past years only one or two serious
bugs have been found and there have been many useful comments passed on
about the functionality of the Library routines and the subjects covered 
by the Level 1 programs.

Release~4 introduces six new programs to the Level 1 Library and many more
Level~0 routines. An important addition is the treatment of two simple
non-linear problems. It is hoped that all these additions will be found
useful to users of the Library and they will provide to starting point
to new areas of application.

The authors of the Library are very interested in suggestions from
users about new areas to be covered and comments about the existing 
material.
The authors can be contacted directly at the Rutherford Appleton 
Laboratory
or through the Numerical Algorithms Group.
