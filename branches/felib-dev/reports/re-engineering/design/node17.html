The <TT>TOOLPACK</TT> Suite</A>
</H2>
For some programs Fortran&nbsp;66 is the implementation language: the use of <TT>GOTO</TT>s, 
arithmetic <TT>IF</TT>s and computed <TT>GOTO</TT> statements.

<P>
<TT>TOOLPACK</TT> is a suite of software tools designed in the 1980s to support the Fortran programmer. 
In this context, a `software tool' is a utility program to assist in the various phases 
of constructing, analysing, testing, adapting, or maintaining a body of Fortran software. 
Typically, the input to such a tool is your Fortran source code. The tool processes this 
and produces output that may have one or both of the following forms:

<UL>
<LI>A report that gives an analysis of the input program, e.g. a summary of the types of statements used; this type of tool is called a static analyser.
</LI>
<LI>A modified version of the input program; in this case, the tool is called a transformer. An example is a formatter which improves the appearance of the code.
</LI>
</UL>
In some cases the input may be test data, documentation, or a report generated by a previously applied tool. Tools that assist directly in preparing documents are usually called documentation generation aids. These and other tools serving utility functions all have an important role to play and so, even if they do not process a program directly, they are still regarded as programming aids.

<P>
Further examples of the software tools provided include:

<UL>
<LI>A text editor with Fortran&nbsp;77 oriented features.
</LI>
<LI>A transforming tool that standardises the declarative part of a Fortran program.
</LI>
<LI>An instrumenter that modifies the program by inserting monitoring and other control statements. The instrumented program is then compiled and executed, and data is gathered that is used to generate reports. Execution of an instrumented program is an example of dynamic analysis. 
</LI>
</UL>
The <TT>TOOLPACK</TT> Suite is public domain and is easily obtained although they are
now of limited use as the community migrates the Fortran 90/95. Some of the tools
contained in <TT>TOOLPACK</TT> have been packaged into the <TT>NAGWare</TT> Fortran&nbsp;77 Tools.
