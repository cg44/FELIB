The Finite Element Library

The Finite Element Library (FELIB) is a program subroutine library for the numerical solution of 
partial differential equations using the finite element method. It has been designed to meet the 
needs of the algorithm developer and is a set of software tools, rather than a package addressing 
one particular area.

As a result the library is very flexible and enables its users to apply the finite element technique 
to any new research area in mathematical physics where packages do not exist, e.g. in free-surface 
flows and non-Newtonian mixing.

The library contains examples of steady-state, time-dependent, linear and non-linear problems. Although 
the examples programs are two-dimensional these can be easily extended to three dimensions.

All the software is written in Fortran and conforms to the ANSI Fortran 77 Standard. Thus the library 
software and any programs written using the library are very portable. This makes the use of the library 
attractive in many forms of co-operative research.

The full documentation of FELIB can be found under the "Docs" tab. Web based documentation can be found 
at the FELIB web site.

FELIB is still under development with both a Fortran 95 and parallel version (PARFEL). The images and 
meshes shown above were produced using the mesh generation and post processing routines developed for 
FELIB. These may be available at a later date on this site.
