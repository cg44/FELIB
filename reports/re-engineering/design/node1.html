Introduction</A>

The Finite Element Library (<TT>FELIB</TT>) [<A
 HREF="node23.html#felib1">1</A>,<A
 HREF="node23.html#felib2">2</A>,<A
 HREF="node23.html#felib3">3</A>] was 
first designed and implemented in the early 1980s and since then 
there have been four releases of the software - Release 4 is the 
current release.

<P>
Many individuals and groups have made use of <TT>FELIB</TT> in developing
finite element based applications and in the teaching of finite
element techniques. Some 3000 known copies of the library are known
to exist (through monitoring <I>httpd</I> and <I>ftp</I> accessing) and there are
probably many other copies obtained through third parties.

<P>
The original library, based on an existing prototype library of Prof&nbsp;IM&nbsp;Smith of
Manchester University [<A
 HREF="node23.html#imsmith1">5</A>], was implemented in Fortran&nbsp;66, with 
subsequent versions making use of Fortran&nbsp;77, as part of one of the Rutherford 
Appleton Laboratory's Engineering Support programs funded by the then SERC 
(now EPSRC). The Numerical Algorithms Group Ltd (Oxford) provided the primary 
outlet to the scientific community. The prototype library was highly re-engineered
and its two-level structure fully documented.

<P>
Although other language versions of the base Fortran&nbsp;66 library were partially 
implemented - C, DAP-Fortran and Ada - it is not until recently that is was 
thought useful to consider developing a Fortran&nbsp;90/95 version. In 1998 Prof&nbsp;Smith
and Dr&nbsp;Griffiths [<A
 HREF="node23.html#imsmith2">6</A>] published a Fortran&nbsp;90/95 version their library which has
grown significantly through the years and there is also a version for SMPD machines [<A
 HREF="node23.html#imsmith3">7</A>].

<P>
Within the CLRC programme FELIB has developed and PVM/MPI versions have been developed [<A
 HREF="node23.html#felib4">4</A>]
as too have a family of pre- and post processing routines tailored to FELIB.
Even though originally designed in the 80s <TT>FELIB</TT> is still well used judged
by the level of Email enquiries and comments.
